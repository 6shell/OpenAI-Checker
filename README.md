# OpenAI-Checker
Used to check if your IP can access OpenAI services.

## Notice
**I have only created this script, and any other websites and programs for OpenAI service availability checking are not my responsibility, so please judge the accuracy by yourself. Theoretically, it is not possible to make accurate judgments through the web side, so it is recommended that you do so through a shell.**

## Detection method
Our detection results come from **Cloudflare** and the accuracy is independent of this script.

## Usage
```shell
bash <(curl -Ls https://cpp.li/openai)
```
or
```shell
bash <(curl -Ls https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/missuo/OpenAI-Checker/openai.sh)
